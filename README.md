### System Overview

1. **Admin Database (DB):**
   - **Purpose:** Central repository for user data, captcha challenges, and transaction records.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Store user profiles, including their roles (Clicker or AC user).
     - Track completed captcha tasks and corresponding rewards.
     - Manage subscription data for AC users.

### Application 1: Clicker

**Description:** The Clicker application is designed for users who want to participate in solving captchas for rewards.

#### Features:

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users create accounts and log in to the Clicker app.
   - Store user credentials and ensure secure authentication.

2. **Captcha Detection and Retrieval:**
   - Integrate an image recognition module to capture and recognize captchas from the user’s screen.
   - Retrieve the captcha images and present them to Clickers for solving.

3. **User Interface:**
   - A clean and intuitive UI displaying the captured captcha images.
   - Options for users to select the correct images (or answer) for the captcha.

4. **Reward System:**
   - Track the number of captchas solved and reward tokens based on accuracy.
   - Display users’ current token balance and the option to redeem tokens for prizes or currency.

5. **Community Features:**
   - Leaderboards or achievement systems to encourage participation and competition among Clickers.

6. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Monitor and display users' performance, such as accuracy rates and completed tasks.

7. **Notifications:**
   - Alert users when new captcha challenges are available or when they have earned tokens.

#### Technical Requirements:

- **Language & Framework:** Could be developed in Python, Java, or any suitable language with GUI capabilities (e.g., Electron for cross-platform).
- **Image Processing Library:** Utilize libraries like OpenCV or TensorFlow for captcha detection.
- **Backend Integration:** API to communicate with the Admin DB for task assignments and token management.

### Application 2: Anti-Captcha (AC)

**Description:** The Anti-Captcha application is a subscription-based service allowing users to pay to avoid seeing captchas entirely.

#### Features:

1. **User Registration and Subscription Management:**
   - Users create accounts and choose subscription plans.
   - Manage payment processing and billing cycles.

2. **Captcha Bypass Mechanism:**
   - Use API integration with the Admin DB to submit captchas for solving.
   - Implement a system to handle captcha requests in real-time, reducing or eliminating user interactions with captchas.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Provide a simple interface for users to manage their subscriptions and view usage statistics (e.g., number of captchas avoided).

4. **Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Display metrics on how many captchas were solved through the service and cost savings compared to traditional methods.

5. **Support and Feedback System:**
   - Enable users to provide feedback and get support for any issues related to the service.

6. **Security Features:**
   - Implement measures to ensure user data is protected and transactions are secure.

#### Technical Requirements:

- **Language & Framework:** Can also be developed using similar technologies as the Clicker app.
- **Payment Integration:** Use payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal for managing subscriptions.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Ensure that the system can handle requests quickly and efficiently.

### Considerations for Both Applications

1. **Ethics and Compliance:**
   - Consider the ethical implications of bypassing captchas and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

2. **User Privacy:**
   - Protect user data, especially for Clickers who may be sharing their screen content.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Design the system to handle increasing numbers of users and captcha challenges efficiently.

4. **Quality Control:**
   - Implement measures to verify the accuracy of the Clickers’ responses to maintain the system's reliability.

5. **Monitoring and Analytics:**
   - Monitor system performance, user engagement, and captcha-solving effectiveness to continuously improve the service.
